# Simple Python Flask app that utilizes Onshape API calls 

### June 23rd 
Built a simple form (minimal error detection, must fix) that allows the user to copy their did, wid, and eid. The server then makes an API call to Onshape that returns configuration details.

Todo: have this API request serve as a method to error-check if the user inputs correct ids. Once a user inputs valid ids, add a list of valid API calls to use.
